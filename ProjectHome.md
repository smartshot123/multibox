This program is similar to other programs such as [Synergy](http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/) which allows you to use a single mouse and keyboard to control multiple computers.  The advantage of multibox over the alternatives is that it uses relative keyboard/mouse movements (which means it works well with games) and it allows for keyboard and mouse broadcasting.

Keyboard and mouse broadcasting means that when you move the mouse your cursor will move on all connected computers and when you press a key on your keyboard that key will effectively be pressed on ll connected computers.  This is particularly useful if you are trying to play multiple characters in a computer game at the same time, though it can also be useful in other scenarios such as presentations.
